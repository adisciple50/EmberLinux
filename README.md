A Compiz Standalone Gentoo Mix

Target user: Debian Intermediate - ANY Arch User - Gentoo Beginner.
Used As: Desktop/Laptop Home Computer - By Speed Freaks using the afforementioned form factors.


Current Phase - Package Selection & Configuration
Currently Moonlighting - A General Purpose Install Script

##Aims##

Everything Should Be Compiled for YOUR System
- this should be done using MARCH=native -O2 and the "localyesconfig" make target for the kernel - since the gentoo install images usually load everything needed.

- Compile times are expected to be long, but good things come to those who wait.

Favour Desktop Environment Independant Software In The Core Build

- the script will aim to install as little dependacies as possible - Keep that /etc/portage/package.use use string small!
- We will leave it up to the competent user to sort out what they are going to use this setup for.

Use python3 as much as possible! its not just a syntax change, its a performance enhancement! (possibly deluded)

##Objectives##

- Expand functionality for cairo dock - make as much as possible done by the dock. NOTE: this could make and excellent landscape style smartwatch port. (unplanned)

- Go absolutely mad with theming  for emerald and cairo-dock! the results of this should be usuable by any distro
